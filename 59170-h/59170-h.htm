<div><img class="drop-cap" src="images/dct.jpg" width="80" height="80" alt="T" /></div>
<p class="drop-cap"><span class="all-caps">The</span> Chinese writing is eminently picturesque;
and as the language admits
of no alphabet, all ideas and objects
are conveyed through the medium of groups of
characters, each group representing a series of
impressions, or opinions. By an ingenious and
elaborate combination of strokes, upwards of 40,000
distinct symbols are perfected. This vast array has
given rise to the amusing, but erroneous notion, that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_x">x</span>
the Chinese pass their lives in learning to read; so
that old and infirm scholars, after having devoted all
their days to its accomplishment, have departed this
life with the task undone.</p>

<p>Ideographic and phonetic at the same time, the
mechanism of the language is intelligible only to
a few Europeans; but it is truly surprising that the
vernacular of 400,000,000 of our fellow-men, whose
literature dates from the time of King David, and
whose yearly exchange of merchandise with England
amounts to £40,000,000 sterling, should have been
so long wrapped in oblivion.</p>

<p>China does not possess, as we do, public libraries
and reading rooms, but all who have a taste for
reading or desire instruction can readily satisfy their
need, as books are sold in the Celestial Empire at
prices lower than in any other country in the world;
further, all the finest quotations from the best authors
are found written on the pagodas, public monuments,
façades of tribunals, signs of the shops, doors of
houses, and interior of apartments, so that, in fact,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xi">xi</span>
China may be likened to a huge library, where rich
and poor alike can enjoy their country’s literature,
and it is deserving of remark that the general
prosperity and peace of China has been much
promoted by the diffusion of knowledge and education
throughout the lower classes.</p>

<p>The construction of the Chinese symbols varies from
the square character to the more cursive character of
the Seal and Grass, peculiar for their obscurity. The
six styles of writing are as follows:—Chuen shoo, or
Seal character; Le shoo, or Official character; Keae
shoo, or Model character; Hing shoo, or Running
character; Tsaov shoo, or Grass character; and
Sung shoo, or Sung dynasty character. The preface
to this book is written by Lo Fong Loh, Esq., in the
“running” character, and is undoubtedly a perfect
specimen of caligraphy; his translation is rendered
in the following pages.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="all-caps">Among</span> the several places of interest
in London, visited by H. E. Li
Fung Pao (Director of the Chinese
Educational Mission) and myself during our six
months’ sojourn therein, I could not fail to be
impressed with the Tea Establishment of Messrs.
Horniman and Co., Wormwood Street. The first
department to which our attention was directed, is
called the “Blending Floors.” Here we observed
divers descriptions of Tea, which had been shipped<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xiii">xiii</span>
from different countries in the Eastern Hemisphere.
Although we do not profess to be <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">au courant</i> with
regard to that particular article of domestic use, still
we happen to come from the Tea districts of China,
and therefore took the opportunity of examining
some specimens of the tropical leaf.</p>

<p>We are aware that in commerce there is a special
kind of so-called Tea, denominated “Reviving Leaf,”
a spurious production, so coloured and prepared as
to deceive the eye of all but experts. This manipulated
“presentment” of the genuine commodity was
not among the varieties; and we are satisfied that
Messrs. Horniman’s Teas are perfectly unsophisticated
and natural growths, free from all adventitious
“additions.” The effect of blending the various
descriptions of Tea is to make the flavour
uniform, and thus to meet the wants and tastes
of the consumers.</p>

<p>One thing particularly struck us during our visit.
This was the vast quantity of Tea in stock, both in the
Warehouses and the Wholesale Establishment. Upon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xiv">xiv</span>
enquiring of the Head of the Firm, whether all their
importations are consumed by the people of the
United Kingdom, the reply was, that “A considerable
portion thereof is exported to European countries.”
This circumstance convinced us that the
Teas are blended with marked technical skill, in order
to suit the various tastes and likings of divers individuals
and nationalities.</p>

<p>When H. E. Li and myself were passing through
the “Blending Floors,” the first remark made
to me by H. E. was this: he observed that “In
China, Tea Merchants invariably separate the different
qualities of the leaf; while the practice in this
country seemed to be the very reverse.” I explained
to him the reason of such usage, comparing it to the
composition of a book. First, you collect information
of sundry kinds; anon, proceed to classify the same;
and, finally, artistically blend the whole for the general
advantage. The Chinese merchants having performed
the first part, Messrs. Horniman &amp; Co. effect the
other equally important portions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_xv">xv</span>
Upon entering what is deemed the “Testing Room,”
we noticed a collection of tiny China cups, filled with
infusions of the leaf. Albeit we did not then taste
the tempting liquid, nevertheless we could not avoid
being favourably impressed with the delicate aroma
and excellent colour of the beverage.</p>

<p>The next department we inspected was the “Weighing
Floors,” which proved no less a source of interest.
In this place the Tea is weighed previous to its being
put into packages, varying in size from two ounces
to several pounds weight. While the smaller packages
are neatly enclosed in tinfoil, so as to prevent the
leaf suffering injury through the action of damp
or exposure, the larger sorts and for export are
done up in tins, securely closed, to obviate the
admission of air.</p>

<p>In the adjoining department, or “Labelling Room,”
the various packages are labelled (the labels being
printed in nine languages), on a similar principle to
that adopted by the Chinese themselves.</p>

<p>Shortly after my arrival in England, I felt<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xvi">xvi</span>
distressed respecting the means of procuring pure
Tea, not drinking coloured Tea in my own country.
I experienced that some of the largest hotels and
leading restaurants seldom produced a beverage
such as I could with pleasure drink. Upon trying
the Tea supplied by Messrs. Horniman’s Agents, I
found it excellent in every respect, and like to that
I have been accustomed to use when at home.</p>

<p>One object of my official visit to Europe being to
collect special information bearing on the Industrial
Arts, as evidences of Western civilisation, I must
confess that both H. E. Li and myself derived
mutual pleasure and profit in going over Messrs.
Horniman’s Establishment.</p>

<div><img class="drop-cap" src="images/dca.jpg" width="79" height="80" alt="A" /></div>
<p class="drop-cap"><span class="all-caps">According</span> to the most authentic
Chinese historians, the Tea plant was
introduced from the Corea in the
eighth century, during the dynasty of Lyang.
Being both approved of and much relished by
the Emperor it was extensively cultivated, so that
it rapidly became popular with all sections of the
community. As this story was too prosaic for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>
general acceptation, the masses, and even certain
sceptical <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">literati</i>, readily received a more poetical
account, which, like many of our own nursery tales,
veils some political allegory.</p>

<p>The story runs, that in the year 510, an Indian
prince—one Darma, third son of King Kosjusva—famed
throughout the East for his religious zeal,
landed in China on a Missionary enterprise. He
devoted all his time and thought to the diffusion of a
knowledge of God. In order to set an example of
piety to others, he imposed on himself various privations
and mortifications, forswore sleep, and, living
mostly in the open air, devoted himself to prayer,
preaching, and contemplation. However, after several
years passed in this excessively austere manner, he
involuntarily fell asleep. Upon awaking, so distressed
was he at having violated his oath that, to prevent a
repetition of such backsliding and never again permit
“tired eyelids” to “rest on tired eyes,” he cut off
those offending portions of his body, and flung them
on the ground. Returning next day to the same spot,
he discovered that his eyelids had undergone a strange
metamorphosis, having been changed into a shrub
the like of which had never before been seen upon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>
the earth. Having eaten some of the leaves, he
found his spirits singularly exhilarated thereby; while
his former vigour was restored. Hence he recommended
the newly-discovered boon to his disciples
and followers, so that after a time the use of Tea
rapidly spread. A portrait of Darma is given by
Kæmpfu, the first authoritative writer on China. At
the foot of the portrait is the representation of a reed,
supposed to be indicative of the religious enthusiast
having crossed rivers and seas in the pursuit of his
mission. It is by no means difficult, out of this
wonderful legend, to extract a moral, namely, that an
earnest individual, who had acquired the useful habit
of keeping his eyes open, discovered one of Nature’s
secrets, which had entirely escaped the observation of
all others.</p>

<p>Towards the close of the sixteenth century, a
learned physician of Padua—one Giovanni Bolero—published
a work “On the Causes of the Magnificence
and Greatness of Cities.” Therein, while treating of
the Orient, he observes: “The Chinese have an herb
out of which they press a delicate juice that serves
them for drink instead of wine; it also preserves their
health and frees them from all those evils which the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
use of wine produces among ourselves.” Albeit the
allusion is somewhat cloudy, still no doubt exists but
that the celebrated Paduan refers to Tea. This is
supposed to be the earliest mention of the plant by
any European writer.</p>

<p>It is curious that among the many wonderful things
which Marco Polo—the great traveller of his day—saw
in China, he omits to mention the Tea plant either
as shrub or beverage. This omission is the more
unaccountable inasmuch as both himself and his
father (whose voyages he records) must have visited
districts wherein Tea was in common use. The early
Portuguese navigators are equally silent on this
matter, nor is mention made thereof in the logs of
our own freebooting Sea Kings. These, however,
troubled themselves less about botany than the broad
pieces to be found in the holds of the Spanish King’s
galleons. Had Sir Walter Raleigh, who travelled
West instead of East, accompanied his friend Drake on
his famous voyage round the world, he might have
added to his discoveries of the potato and tobacco
plants of America, that of Tea in China. The
honour of introducing the refreshing and invigorating
leaf to Europe was, clearly, not reserved for English<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>
travellers. This honour is properly claimed by the
Portuguese, although they had been trading for many
years with the Chinese before they made the discovery,
just about the close of the sixteenth century.</p>

<div id="ip_21" class="figcenter newpage" style="max-width: 44em;">

  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">A Tea Garden.</span>—The Tea plant flourishes best in the provinces of To-kien, Kiang-su,
Hoonam and Hoopels. The first crop is gathered in the early spring.</div></div>

<p>Shortly after Tea had become a popular beverage
in China, it was exported to Japan, the only nation
with which the Chinese were suffered to hold intercourse.
In those islands it assumed even a more
important position than it held in the “Flowery Land,”
so that to be able to make and serve the beverage
with a polished grace was recognised as an indubitable
sign of a polite and aristocratic education. The
Japanese devoted their artistic and mechanical skill
to the production of tea-caddies, tea-trays, tea-pots,
and tea-cups and saucers, remarkable for exquisiteness
of design no less than peculiarity of fabric. Tea-houses
were opened in the leading cities of Japan.
These were frequented by the Daimios, or lesser
nobles, and the lower classes alike, who took their
chief pleasure in such popular resorts.</p>

<p>Eminent writers, also, considered it no indignity
to extol the precious beverage. What Bacchanalian
and hunting songs, cavalier and sea songs, rhapsodical
treatises in laudation of hunting, coaching, and so forth,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>
are to the literature of England, such was Tea to the
writers, artists, and musicians of China and Japan.
In other words their Dickenses, their Goldsmiths,
their Nimrods, their Dibdins, their Tom Moores,
and their Leeches, instead of having a wide variety of
topics to treat of, as was the case with their English
compeers, were confined to one subject—Tea. Indeed,
each plantation was supposed to possess its peculiar
virtues and excellences, like to the slightly varying
vineyards of the Rhine, the Rhone, the Garonne, or
the Moselle. Each had its poet to sing its praises in
running rhymes. In illustration, one Chinese bard,
who seemingly was an Anacreon in his way, magnifies
the shrub that grows on the Mong-shan mountains,
in the territory of Ya-chew, in words which, literally
translated, <span class="locked">mean:—</span></p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">“One ounce doth all disorders cure,<br /></span>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_A" href="#FNanchor_A" class="fnanchor">A</a> An immortal.</p></div>

<p>However hyperbolical this testimony may be considered,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>
it at least serves to show the high estimation
in which Tea was held. This fact furnishes the best
possible answer to the silly objections of certain modern
writers who would fain have us believe that the
Chinese cultivate Tea, not for their own consumption,
but to sell to foreigners. The only gleam of truth
latent in so manifestly absurd an assertion being that
the Celestials invariably drink the <em>pure</em> Tea, not that
which has undergone artificial preparation for those
outer barbarians, the English consumers, it being an
admitted fact that they prepare Tea “to order,” and
can by the aid of mineral facing-powder transform
black Tea into green, or green Tea into black at
pleasure. Such transformation, however, only alters
the appearance to the eye; the quality, inferior or
otherwise, remains concealed.</p>

<p>In due time Tea became, not simply in China and
Japan, but also in India and Persia, the drink of
ceremony, just as is coffee with the Turks and Arabs,
and wine with ourselves. A little over two centuries
since, a French traveller in Persia gravely imagined
that what constituted a hospitable custom, was a
universal desire to administer medicine. He avers
that people “assigned to Tea such extravagant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
qualities that, imagining it alone able to keep a man in
constant health, they treated those who came to visit
them with this drink at all hours.” This statement
might be paralleled by an Eastern writer who, treating
of England, should use the same sentence, merely
substituting the word “wine” for “Tea,” and he may
add, “to increase the beneficial influence of the
beverage, in many instances they make cabalistic
movements with the glasses, sometimes clinking the
edges together, meanwhile uttering the talismanic
words, ‘Your health!’ which are supposed to possess
some potent charm.”</p>

<span class="subhead">INTRODUCTION OF TEA INTO ENGLAND.</span></h2>
</div>

<div><img class="drop-cap" src="images/dcb.jpg" width="80" height="80" alt="B" /></div>
<p class="drop-cap"><span class="all-caps">Before</span> Tea found its way to England, it
had been brought to Holland, thanks to
the treaty made by the Dutch with the
Japanese. If the Dutchman, as a rule, did not forego
his favourite lager and schnapps to take to Tea so
readily as did the English, nevertheless, there were
not wanting upholders of the new beverage in the
land of “dykes, ducks, and Dutchmen,” as somebody
construed Voltaire’s famous “<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">cancana, canards,
canaille</i>.” The first to advocate the wonderful leaf
was Cornelius Bontekoe, principal physician to the
Elector of Brandenburgh, a Professor in the University
of Leyden, and a man of more than ordinary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
eminence. In a treatise on “Tea, Coffee, and Chocolate,”
published in 1679, he strongly pronounces
in favour of the first-named drink, and denies
the possibility of its being hurtful to health, even if
taken in such an inordinate quantity as one or two
hundred cups a day, a statement as extravagant as it
is impracticable.</p>

<p>The introduction of Tea into England is by some
presumed to date from the year of our Lord 1652.
If such be authentic, the quantity of the leaf imported
during the Commonwealth must have been extremely
limited, probably not exceeding a few pounds, such
as Blake and “sea-dogs” of his order discovered in
the cabins of ships they had captured from the Dutch.
Equally questionable is the statement of other authorities,
who give the year 1666 as that wherein the first
importation of Tea took place. No doubt, many important
events were commonly attributed to the year
1666, which the poet Dryden had essayed to render
more remarkable still by his poem on the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Annus
Mirabilis</i>. Lords Arlington and Orrery are credited
with having first rendered the drinking of Tea fashionable.
Six years previous to the remarkable year just
noticed, Pepys records in his “Diary”: “I sent for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
a cup of Tea, a Chinese drink, of which I had never
drunk before.” So that it is evident the rare beverage
was then coming into use. Shortly afterwards a
measure passed the legislature, enacting that an
impost of eightpence per gallon should be paid on
all Tea prepared and sold in coffee-houses.</p>

  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Gathering the Spring Crop.</span>—The leaves are plucked with great care, not more than one being
plucked from the stalk at a time; notwithstanding this, an expert can gather 10 to 13 lbs. per day.</div></div>

<p>A singular handbill was issued by Thomas Garway,
the founder of Garraway’s somewhat famous coffee-house,
in Exchange (subsequently Exchange-alley).
This announcement was by chance discovered some
years since in a volume of pamphlets in the “King’s
Library,” British Museum, where it may still be
inspected. Albeit the document bears no date, but
there is ample internal evidence to prove that it had
been printed about the year 1660. It purposes to be
“An exact description of the growth, quality, and
virtues of the leaf Tea, by Thomas Garway, in
Exchange-alley, near the Royal Exchange, in London,
Tobacconist and Seller and Retailer of Tea and
Coffee.”</p>

<p>Subjoined is the quaint description given of the
<span class="locked">plant:—</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Tea is generally brought from China, and groweth there
upon little shrubs and bushes, the branches whereof are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>
well garnished with white flowers, that are yellow within,
of the bigness and fashion of sweet-briar, but in smell
unlike, bearing their green leaves, about the bigness of
scordium, myrtle, or sumach, and is judged to be a kind
of sumach. This plant hath been reported to grow wild
only, but doth not; for they plant it in their gardens,
about four foot distance, and it groweth about four foot
high, and of the seeds they maintain and increase their
stock. Of all places in China this plant groweth in
greatest plenty in the province of Xemsi, latitude 36°,
bordering upon the west of the province of Nanking, near
the city of Luchow, the Island de Ladrones and Japan,
and is called ‘Cha.’ Of this famous leaf there are divers
sorts (though all one shape), some much better than
others, the upper leaves excelling the others in fineness,
a property almost in all plants; which leaves they gather
every day, and drying them in the shade, or in iron pans
over a gentle fire, till the humidity be exhausted, then put
close up in leaden pots, preserve them for their drink.
<em>Tea</em>, which is used at meals and upon all visits and entertainments
in private families, and in the palaces of
grandees; and it is owned by a padee of Macas, native of
Japan, that the best Tea ought to be gathered by virgins,
who are destined for this work.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>“The said leaf is of such known virtues, that those very
nations so famous for antiquity, knowledge, and wisdom,
do frequently sell it among themselves for twice its weight
in silver, and the high estimation of the drink made there-with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span>
hath occasioned an inquiry into the nature thereof
amongst the most intelligent persons of all nations that
have travelled in those parts, who after exact tryal and
experience by all wayes imaginable, have commended it to
the use of their several countries, and for its virtues and
operations. The quality is moderately hot, proper for
winter and summer. The drink is declared to be most
wholesome, preserving in perfect health until extreme
old age.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Then the writer proceeds at considerable length
to enumerate the “Vertues” of Tea, some of which
are decidedly apocryphal. Amongst other properties
attributed to the beverage are those of making the
body active and lusty, helping the headache, giddiness,
and heaviness, removing difficulty of breathing, clearing
the sight, removing lassitude, strengthening the
stomach and liver, causing good appetite and digestion,
vanquishing heavy dreams, easing the frame, strengthening
the memory, preventing sleepiness, “so that
whole nights may be spent in study without hurt to
the body,” strengthening the inward parts and preventing
consumption, especially when drank with
milk. “And that the virtues and excellencies of this
leaf and drink,” continues Mr. Garway, “are many
and great is evident and manifest by the high esteem<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
and use of it among the physicians and knowing men
of France, Italy, Holland, and other parts of Christendom,
while in England it hath been sold in the leaf
for six pounds, and sometimes ten pounds for the one
pound weight; and in respect of its former scarceness
and dearness, it hath only been used as a regalia in
high treatments, and presents made thereof to princes
and grandees till the year 1657.</p>

<p>“The said Thomas Garway,” so the handbill proceeds,
“did purchase a quantity thereof and first
publicly sold the said Tea in leaf and drink, made
according to the directions of the most knowing merchants
and travellers in those Eastern countries, and
upon knowledge and experience of the said Thomas
Garway’s continual care and industry in obtaining
the best Tea, and making drink thereof, very many
noblemen, physicians, and merchants, and gentlemen
of quality, have ever since sent to him for the said
leaf, and daily resort to his house in Exchange-alley
aforesaid, to drink the drink thereof.”</p>

<p>Finally the writer closes his remarkable encomium
in these words: “And that ignorance nor envy may
have no ground or power to report or suggest that
which is here asserted of the vertues and excellences<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>
of this precious leaf and drink hath more of design
than truth, for its justification of himself and the
satisfaction of others he hath here enumerated several
authors who in their learned works have expressly
written and asserted the same and much more
in honour of his noble leaf and drink, viz.:—Bontius,
Riccius, Jarricas, Almeyda, Horstius, Alvarez,
Sameda, Martinivus in his <cite>China Atlas</cite>, and
Alexander de Rhodes in <cite>Voyage and Missions</cite>, in a
large discourse of the ordering of this leaf and the
many vertues of the drink; printed at Paris, 1653,
part x. chap. 13. And to the end that all persons of
eminency and quality, gentlemen and others, who
have occasion for Teas in leaf, may be supplied, these
are to give notice that the said Thomas hath Tea to
sell from <em>sixteen to fifty shillings in the pound</em>.”</p>

<p>Doubtless if the beverage possessed even but a
tithe of the virtues and excellences attributed to it
by the celebrated Garway, it must be regarded as the
crowning boon of Nature to man.</p>

</div>

<div><img class="drop-cap" src="images/dct.jpg" width="80" height="80" alt="T" /></div>
<p class="drop-cap"><span class="all-caps">That</span> the worthy Thomas Garway, to
whom reference is made in the
preceding Chapter, gave rather undue
license to his imagination in extolling the virtues of
his cherished beverage is manifest. His handbill,
however, is not only curious but interesting, if on no
other account than that of illustrating the mode of
advertising to which he resorted, in order to spread
the fame of the precious leaf and dispose of his
commodity. It is likewise noteworthy on account of
the fame which “Garway’s Tea” had acquired and
maintained for two centuries.</p>

<p>The original name “Garway” was changed or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>
“restored” by his son to “Garraway,” while the
House which bore this appellation became renowned
far and wide. Here it was that the numerous schemes
which surrounded and accompanied the great South
Sea Bubble, had their centre. Appropriately enough
also, “Garraway’s” was the head-quarters of the
remarkable Tea speculation of 1841–2, when prices
fluctuated sixpence and eightpence per pound; and
when people were suddenly smitten with the mania
for dealing in Tea, just as at other times a rage
obtained for speculating in railways, mines, foreign
funds, or finance.</p>

<p>Albeit Garway evidently prospered in his special
branch of trade, yet it is probable that the rapid
popularity which Tea had acquired was less indebted
to the “learned and knowing” authorities he quoted
in his handbill, than to royal patronage. It appears
that Catherine of Braganza, queen of Charles II.,
who had tasted the beverage in Portugal, and grew
enamoured with the same, brought it into fashion in
this country. Her fondness for the soothing cup was
extreme. Its subsequent popularity, however, may
fairly be attributed to its innate valuable properties,
which became the more understood and prized in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>
proportion as the public grew more addicted to its
daily use. Ladies of <em>ton</em> delighted in their “dish
of Tea,” which was indispensable to their comfort.
Authors also discovered its advantages as a beverage
to work upon; while poets and essayists lauded it
well nigh in terms of extravagant eulogy, such as
had been employed by Chinese and Japanese men of
letters before them.</p>

<p>Almost the first literary eulogist to espouse the
cause of the new drink was Edmund Waller. He
recites how he became induced to taste Tea, owing
to a parcel of the leaf being presented to him in the
year 1664, by a member of the Jesuit Order, who
had recently returned from China. In the poem
which furnishes several references to the infused
leaf occurs the following pregnant <span class="locked">allusion:—</span></p>

<span class="subhead">THE PLANT BOTANICALLY CONSIDERED.</span></h2>
</div>

<div><img class="drop-cap" src="images/dct.jpg" width="80" height="80" alt="T" /></div>
<p class="drop-cap"><span class="all-caps">The</span> Linnæan system of Botany classifies
the Tea plant with the <i>Polyandria</i>, and of
the order <i>Monogynia</i>. What is styled the
“Natural System” associates it with the family of the
Camellia. The Tea plant, which is an evergreen, grows
to the height of five or six feet. The leaves are about
an inch and a half long, being narrow, indented, and
tapering to a point, similar to those of the sweetbriar.
The colour is a dark green. The root is like that of the
peach-tree, while the flowers resemble the wild rose.
A number of irregular branches issue from the stem.
The fruit is small, containing round blackish seeds,
about the size of a bean. The shrub must have at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>
least a three years’ growth before it is fit for being
plucked. This valuable plant is largely cultivated
not only in China but also in India, Japan, and the
Eastern Archipelago. There are two primary kinds
of Tea, namely the <i>Thea viridis</i>, or green shrub, and
the <i>Thea Bohea</i>, or black plant. The former delights
in elevated situations and a temperate climate; the
latter requires the protection of valleys, the sloping
sides of mountains, and the banks of rivers, with a
more tropical sun. To the situations and the temperatures
the delicate flavour of the green and the
greater astringency of the black Tea, are mainly due.</p>

<p>In England, at one period, all descriptions of black
Tea were denominated <i>Bohea</i>. It is known, however,
that this particular title belongs exclusively to
inferior varieties, and in no way includes such
superior products as Congou, Souchong, Pekoe, and
I may add Caper, which is regarded as a fancy
growth, and never imported into this country, unless
adulterated. Of the green Teas, the commonest and
cheapest is Twankay, the finest sort being Hyson,
which comprises Young Hyson and Gunpowder.
There are a number of intermediate and less known
varieties, to which must be added the fine growths of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>
Assam and other provinces of British India. The
Tea plant may be cultivated with more or less success
in climates within 35° or 40° of the Equator. Some
writers affirm that so long as the temperature be
suitable, the character of the soil is of little importance.
Others, on the contrary, assert that Tea will
grow in any part of China or India, even much
further north than I have mentioned. The balance
of experience, however, is against them.</p>

<p>As regards the quality of Tea, this must depend
not only on its variety and growth, but also on the
time during which the leaves are gathered. Directly
the refreshing spring showers have passed off, and
a gracious sunshine succeeds, which, aided by drying
winds, chases away each leaflet’s tears, the Tea
harvesting season commences with vigour. Hundreds,
and occasionally thousands, of little merry
leaf-gatherers may be seen sallying forth at early
morning to their pleasant labour, singing, laughing,
prattling, and dancing as they go. Then when the
mid-day gong sounds, work ceases for the nonce,
when these pretty, black-eyed, dark-haired damsels
squat in groups among the bushes, while they
partake of their frugal meal of rice, moistened by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>
copious draughts of hot weak Tea. Immense care
is necessary in order to protect the delicate young
leaf from injury. As a rule, the girls employed
undergo a species of training to prepare them for
their work. Not only so, but while engaged in
plucking the flowery Pekoe they wear gloves of
perfumed leather. Every leaf has to be plucked
separately. Still so expert are the pluckers that an
average gathering would amount to twelve pounds
weight daily for each person. There are three
seasons. The first commences at the end of
February, or the beginning of March; the second
about the end of March, or the first week of April;
third at the end of May, or in June. The earliest
leaves constitute the most exquisite and expensive
teas; while the second crop forms the largest
proportion of the entire produce.</p>

<p>The best description is the produce of the early
spring when the leaves are young and small. But
many growers, for the sake of increased quantity,
prefer gathering the leaves later in the season, when
they are not simply larger, heavier, and more numerous,
but when they have lost much of their pristine
flavour. Of course, only experts, who devote their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>
lives to the work, can distinguish the difference
between the various growths of early spring or late
autumn. Consequently, the ordinary consumer of
Tea is compelled to trust to the integrity of the
particular retailer from whom he procures this commodity.
But as the majority of retail grocers do not
profess to know the true value of Tea, it follows that
they in their turn, have to place implicit trust in the
better judgment of the wholesale dealer, commercial
traveller, or middle man with whom they do business.</p>

<p>Tracing the history of Tea to a very early period,
we find that complaints of adulteration were very prevalent.
In England the chief deception practised,
consisted in the admixture of sloe and other leaves
with the genuine article. The re-drying of leaves
that had been already used was a malpractice equally
as disgraceful. The Tea so tampered with was little
better than a mass of woody fibre, destitute of those
chemical properties upon the presence of which the
value and virtue of this tropical beverage depend.
More mischievous still was the practice adopted some
time since by which an ingenious mixture of sumach
leaves and catechu was made to resemble Tea, so that
ordinary persons could not detect the counterfeit.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
Yet, notwithstanding the last-mentioned substance,
from its powerfully astringent action on the system,
was calculated to induce serious mischief to health,
this objectionable compound was literally sold under
the protection of a patent, and was known in the
trade as “La Veno Beno, the Chinese Tea Improver.”
The public, however, heard nothing of this impudent
fraud, until after the scheme succeeded and all the
mischief had been done.</p>

<p>Bad as are the adulterations of the leaf practised in
this country, those adopted by the Chinese are even
worse. Not very long since, much commotion was
created respecting “Lie Tea,” which was thrust in the
market. This “base presentment” consisted either
wholly, or in great part, of leaves which had no
affiliation whatever to the Tea plant, but consisted of
leaves and weeds gathered anyhow, then rolled and
dried, and artificially flavoured so as to resemble the
genuine article. With reference to what is called
green Tea, the system frequently pursued in its preparation
is highly reprehensible. The Green Teas sold
in England are usually artificially coloured in order to
enamour the eye of the unsuspecting purchaser. The
principal medium employed in effecting this result is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>
none other than Prussian blue, a deadly poison, and
inimical to health even in the minutest quantity.
According to Mr. Fortune, no less a proportion
than half-a-pound is used to every hundred weight
of leaf.</p>

<p>Although botanists have divided Tea into two
species, still the black and green descriptions are but
varieties of the same plant. Practically it is found
more convenient to cultivate each sort separately,
certain districts favouring the specific growths. But
any description of black Tea can, in the process
of drying, be converted into green. Of course
the Chinese never touch these artificially-coloured
products. They have too much good sense for that.
While they consider the English fools for their pains,
inasmuch as the pretty colour tickles their fancy,
and they are induced to pay a higher price for the
sophisticated commodity.</p>

<span class="subhead">HISTORY OF THE TEA TRADE.</span></h2>
</div>

<div><img class="drop-cap" src="images/dci.jpg" width="79" height="80" alt="I" /></div>
<p class="drop-cap in01"><span class="all-caps">In</span> 1658, the Honourable East India Company
directed to be “sent home by their
ships one hundred pounds weight of the
best Tea they could get,” this doubtless being considered
a pretty large supply. The company had
previously presented to Catherine of Braganza, on her
birthday, a chest containing twenty-two pounds—a
notable gift commemorated by Waller. In 1671 came
the Ty-wan present from the Ruler of Bantam.
During the three subsequent years, the company bought
of Mr. Thomas Garway and others 562½ lbs. of Tea,
which was either given away or consumed by the
Court of Committee. From 1675 to 1677, no record<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>
exists of either purchases or imports. Hence, it is
evident that Tea was not regarded as a source of private
revenue at that period. Who could have fancied the
marvellous change that a century or two would
effect? Who could have thought that the Tea trade
was destined to become one of the most important
branches of our commerce, and not only so, but to
occasion several wars, lead to the extension of our
Eastern possessions, and precipitate the great Chinese
exodus, which threatens such important results to
the Pacific States of America, to Australia, the
Polynesian Islands, and possibly to the world at
large?</p>

<p>There is nothing in the history of commerce so
marvellous as the growth and development of the
trade in Tea. In 1675, the importation of this commodity
rose to 4,713 lbs. But this enormous quantity
manifestly overstocked the market for seven years
afterwards. In 1685, the importations amounted to
a little over 12,000 lbs. Four years later, 25,000
lbs. arrived, which caused the market to be glutted
for a lengthened period, giving rise to considerable
depression in that special branch of commerce. About
this period the duty was taken off the “made” Tea,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
and a regular impost of five shillings per pound
imposed. During the first twelve years of the
eighteenth century, the total quantity of Tea imported
was 1,102,070 lbs., showing an average of 91,922½ lbs.
This result is the more remarkable as it exceeded the
previously unheard of quantity imported in 1700. Yet
we find that in the eleven years succeeding, this
amount became nearly doubled, probably owing to a
reduction of duty to four shillings a pound, in addition
to a Customs’ impost of 14 per cent. The Tea trade,
still ever augmenting, received a further impetus in
1746, when the duty was reduced to one shilling a
pound, the Customs’ duty being fixed at 25 per cent.
During the following twelve years the average importation
amounted to 2,558,080 lbs. Another period of
eight years (1760–67) gives an average of 4,333,267 lbs.
Then taking an additional ten years to complete the
century, the first really commercial importation of 4713
lbs. in 1778, had grown to an average of 6,948,238 lbs.,
and this, notwithstanding that besides the 25 per
cent. Customs’ duty and the one shilling per pound
Excise impost, there had been imposed an additional
Excise 30 per cent. Further, in the concluding six
years of the century, the Tea importations had further<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span>
augmented to 21,706,718 lbs., the 91,183 lbs. of
1700 having become a century later upwards of
<em>twenty-five million pounds</em>.</p>

<p>In 1784 the Commutation Act passed the Legislature.
By its provisions the East India Company were
compelled to make quarterly sales of Tea, to sell even
as low as one penny a pound above prime cost, and
to keep a sufficient quantity for one year’s consumption
always on hand. The same year Mr. Pitt
reduced the duty to 12½ per cent., to which act is
ascribed the enormous increase in the trade. Although
in 1795 the duty was raised to 20 per cent., still the
consumption of Tea increased. Early in the nineteenth
century other fiscal changes occurred. The
Customs’ duty, for example, was fixed at 6 per cent.,
and the Excise duty 90 per cent. in value; while in
1819 the former impost was repealed, and the latter
made cent. per cent. However, nothing that statesmen
or financiers could effect seemed to check the
growing fondness of English people of all social
grades for their cherished beverage. Accordingly we
find that during the first twenty-seven years of the
present century—a period which completes the third
fifty years of the Tea trade—the average annual<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>
consumption amounted to about <em>twenty-nine million
pounds</em>.</p>

<p>Since 1827, the intervening half century has
witnessed several fiscal changes in the Tea trade. The
first and most important occurred in 1834, when the
Excise duty became removed, differential Customs’
duties were imposed, and the long-existing monopoly
of the East India Company was abolished. In 1835,
practically the first year of free trade, the imports
exceeded by 30 per cent. any previous period. The
following year, at the request of the Tea dealers and
brokers, the differential duties were repealed, and a
fixed impost of two shillings in the pound imposed, the
result being an increase of importation to the extent of
fifty million pounds. In 1840, a rate of 5 per cent.
was charged, thus raising the duty to 2s. 2¼d. per
pound.</p>

  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Drying.</span>—A basket frame, wide at both ends and contracted towards the centre,

<p>Although the war with China, coupled with the
simultaneous distress in the manufacturing districts,
caused a temporary check to importation, still the
conclusion of peace and the repeal of the Corn Laws
had their due effect in an opposite direction. Hence,
in 1849, the quantity imported reached very nearly
fifty-three and a half million pounds, while in the
year of the first Great Exhibition, the importation
had augmented to about seventy-one and a half<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>
million pounds. In 1853, an Act was passed reducing
the duty immediately to 1s. 10d., and gradually to
1s. Owing, however, to the outbreak of the Crimean
war, this measure was not carried out. From April,
1855, until April, 1857, the duty remained at 1s. 9d.,
being at this latter date reduced to 1s. 6d. Five years
later a reduction of 6d. took place, and again in
June, 1865, a further reduction. Since then no
fiscal change has been effected. The effects of
these fluctuations have been sufficiently marked,
probably demonstrating that no further reduction,
short of absolute abolition, would prove much of
a boon to consumers.</p>

<p>In 1861, the imports increased to ninety-six and a
half million pounds; the following year to close upon
one hundred and fifteen millions, in 1863 to nearly
one hundred and thirty-seven millions, in 1866 to one
hundred and forty millions, and in 1877, to the enormous
figure of nearly one hundred and eighty-eight
million pounds (187,721,050 lbs. actually). Thus
in two centuries, since the time of Thomas Garway’s
handbill offering a few pounds of Tea to a select<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>
public, the trade has grown with prodigious strides
into a highly flourishing branch of commerce representing
value to the extent of some twelve millions
sterling, and an addition to the imperial revenue
at even the existing duty, of over four and a half
millions, irrespective of the value of the thirty-two
million pounds re-exported from our shores.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE COLOURING OF THE LEAF.</span></h2>
</div>

<div><img class="drop-cap" src="images/dcp.jpg" width="80" height="80" alt="P" /></div>
<p class="drop-cap"><span class="all-caps">Previous</span> to 1834, the Honourable
East India Company, possessing the
monopoly of the Tea trade, were
responsible, under very stringent regulations, for
the quality of the leaf imported, while heavy
penalties were inflicted on those who coloured or
adulterated Tea in England. Now that the trade has
been thrown open, and the duties so largely reduced,
little inducement exists for having recourse to malpractices
in this country, even had there been no
Adulteration Act in force. Yet is there no protection
against what is done in China. Some years since, the
City Commissioners made a commendable but abortive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>
effort to seize “Lie Tea” and Teas artificially coloured
and otherwise adulterated; but inasmuch as duty had
duly been paid on the rubbish, it was found that
nothing could be done to arrest the distribution of
such vile stuff.</p>

<p>That the English public prefer unsophisticated Tea,
when they can conveniently obtain it, is conclusively
established by Messrs. Horniman &amp; Co.’s long
experience. The Firm has Agents in every town
throughout the kingdom, each of whom is constantly
receiving supplies of the genuine article. Ten years
ago, the Firm paid duty on <em>seven hundred and seventy
four thousand pounds</em> of Tea, while last year they
sold upwards of <em>five million packets</em> varying in sizes
from two ounces to three pounds weight. This result
is sufficiently conclusive in negativing the flimsy
assertion made and reiterated by interested persons,
namely, that English folk favour artificially coloured
Teas, rejecting those which are not so manipulated.</p>

<p>It must be admitted that inexperienced judges of
the pure leaf, upon their first purchase are surprised
at the colour of the leaf. They pronounce the
black Tea to be dark brown, and the green Tea, a
dark olive. The exquisite flavour of the “supreme<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>
beverage” at once opens their eyes to the truth.
No doubt it is reassuring to be aware that a Firm
which, by common consent of their customers, consistently
and persistently act up to their business
formula, “Always good alike,” find meet reward in a
yearly augmentation of their business; a fact attested
by the published tables of the quantities of Tea on
which they pay duty periodically. But in addition
to obtaining <em>quality</em>, the public have the extra
advantage of <em>cheapness</em>, as the Pure Tea offered by
Messrs. Horniman &amp; Co.’s Agents is sold at the
same fixed prices in every Town and Village
throughout the Kingdom. If, as the proverb has
it, “Good wine needs no bush,” so, on the other
hand, good Tea, like beauty, needs no adornment.
Its best adornment is perfect purity.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="all-caps">Since</span> the introduction of Tea into
England, but more especially since the
British public has patronised it, a
marked improvement characterises the tone and
manners of Society. It is not, possibly, too great
an assumption to assert that there must exist something
about Tea specially suitable to the English
constitution and climate; for not even in Scotland or
Ireland, nor in any European country, is the beverage
consumed to a like extent. Certain travellers aver
that a large consumption of the leaf obtains in Russia;
but it is chiefly the upper classes who are addicted to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span>
its use. The moujiks, peasants, and artisans scarcely
know the taste of it, for now, as in the time of
Peter the Great, they regard <em>vodká</em> as their only
national drink.</p>

and turmeric are added, except to that tea ordered pure and free from all mineral facing powder.</div></div>

<p>That all classes of the community in this country
have derived much benefit from the persistent use of
Tea, is placed beyond dispute. It has proved, and
still proves, a highly prized boon to millions. The
artist at his easel, the author at his desk, the statesman
fresh from an exhaustive oration, the actor from
the stage after fulfilling an arduous <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">rôle</i>, the
orator from the platform, the preacher from the
pulpit, the toiling mechanic, the wearied labourer,
the poor governess, the tired laundress, the
humble cottage housewife, the votary of pleasure
even, on escaping from the scene of revelry, nay,
the Queen on her throne, have, one and all, to
acknowledge and express gratitude for the grateful
and invigorating infusion.</p>

<p>Shortly after it had became fashionable to partake
of Tea, persons of quality in England were wont to
invite their friends to a “dish” of the newly-imported
beverage. Lord Macaulay mentions how “Tea, which
at the time Monk brought the Army of Scotland to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>
London (<span class="smcap smaller">A. D.</span> 1660), had been handed round to be
stared at and just touched with the lips as a great
rarity of China, was, eighty years later, a regular
article of import, and was soon consumed in such
quantities that financiers began to consider it as an
important source of revenue.” Seven years later
Pepys has this entry in his famous Diary: “Home,
and there find my wife making of Tea, a drink
which Mr. Pelling, the apothicary, tells her is
good for her cold.” That Queen Anne ranked
among the votaries of the leaf is manifest from
Pope’s <span class="locked">couplet:—</span></p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">“Thou, great Anna, whom three realms obey,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dost sometimes counsel take, and sometimes Tay.”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>From this time forth writers of renown make
constant allusions to the new drink. Essayists in the
<cite>Spectator</cite>, the <cite>Tatler</cite>, and other literary organs, are
ever dropping remarks respecting the tea-table. Pope,
in his “Rape of the Lock,” when Belinda is declaring
what terrible things she would rather have had
happen, than have lost her favourite curl, makes
her cap everything by the wish that she could be
transported <span class="locked">to—</span></p>

</div></div>
</div>

<p class="in0">than which privation she can imagine nothing
worse.</p>

<p>Then what a source of social pleasure the “afternoon
Tea” becomes! Brady, in his well known
metrical version of the “Psalms,” thus illustrates the
advantages accruing <span class="locked">therefrom:—</span></p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">“When in discourse of Nature’s mystic powers<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And noblest themes, we pass the well spent hours,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whilst all around the Virtues—sacred band—<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And listening Graces, pleased attendants stand.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus our Tea conversations we employ,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Quaffing without the waste of time or wealth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sovereign drink of pleasure and of health.”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>The poet Cowper’s praise of the beverage has
been sadly hackneyed; nevertheless, as the Laureate
of the tea-table, his lines are worthy of further
reproduction. Who cannot recall how Mrs.
Gilpin scornfully characterises her neighbours’
children as being markedly inferior to her own,</p>

<div class="poem-container">

that the melancholy friend of the hares <span class="locked">exclaims:—</span></p>

<span class="i0">So let us welcome peaceful evening in.”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>But Tea had its avowed enemies no less than its
staunch friends. Certain old fashioned physicians did
not like it. Nay, they even sneered at and denounced
it. Jonas Hanway, the philanthropic but eccentric
founder of the Marine and the Magdalen Societies,
more bold than his compeers, actually rushed into
print in order to inveigh against it. But he had
reason to regret his hot-headed impetuosity. In
answer to his petty attack, the beverage found a
noble defender in no less a personage than Dr.
Johnson, whose defence, in point of style, is among
the best essays the great moralist ever penned.
Hanway, however, nothing daunted, resumed the
attack. Having lost his temper, he gave full scope to
his prejudices, and denounced Tea as the worst of
poisons and the secondary cause of all the moral,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span>
religious, and political evils that distracted mankind.
Not only so, but he was rash enough to attack the
leviathan of literature personally. Yet he had far
better have saved his ink, for Johnson—the first time
in his life that he had retorted on an adversary—fell
upon him like an avalanche. Hanway having
foolishly laid himself open to ridicule, most assuredly
the Doctor did not spare him. Such a contest, of
course, could not be regarded as equal. No possible
comparison existed between the combatants. Therefore,
setting aside all the hard knocks which Johnson
administered to poor Jonas, it will be sufficient to produce
one passage in which the eminent writer declares
himself “a hardened sinner in the use of the infusion
of this plant, whose tea-pot had no time to cool,
who with Tea solaced the midnight, and with Tea
welcomed the morning.” There is not the slightest
exaggeration in this confession. What is affirmed
therein is attested both by Boswell and Mrs. Thrale
in their respective writings, who record that Dr.
Johnson frequently exceeded a dozen large cups at
one meal.</p>

<p>It is alleged that the first command given
by our gracious Queen upon her accession to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span>
Throne was “Bring me a cup of Tea and <cite>The Times</cite>.”
It is to be hoped that Her Majesty got the former
uncoloured.</p>

<p>For a time it appeared that so far as one class of
the community was concerned, the use of Tea was
likely to be checked by the imperious sway of inconstant
Fashion. It became the custom in the houses
of the aristocracy to supply only coffee after dinner,
so that, for a period, Tea was ostracised. Recently
however, a reaction has set in, for we find that the
most agreeable meetings in “Society” are those
which assemble at “the five o’clock Tea.” Accordingly
one of the whirligigs of time has so conspired,
that while the fashionable breakfast and dinner hours
are completely revolutionised, the hour for Tea has
reverted to the precise period of the day at which it
used to be taken one hundred years ago. Although
noble ladies have not now black pages to hand round
the tea-cups, yet the very china used by their great
grandmothers is called into requisition simply because
of its antiquity. One circumstance calls for special
notice. It is this, that in the words of Dr. Johnston<a id="FNanchor_B" href="#Footnote_B" class="fnanchor">B</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span>
“Everywhere unintoxicating and non-narcotic
beverages are in general use among tribes of every
colour, beneath every sun, and in every condition
of life. The custom, therefore, must meet some
universal want of our common nature.”</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_B" href="#FNanchor_B" class="fnanchor">B</a> Chemistry of Common Life.</p></div>

<p>Philanthropists and sociologists are now fully alive
to the moral effects produced by such non-intoxicant
drinks as Tea and Coffee. Intemperance is the bane
of the nation. And now that legislation has utterly
failed to restrain the evils arising therefrom, philanthropy,
full of faith in the experiment, endeavours
by the establishment, in divers quarters, of quite a
different class of “Public Houses,” to arrest an evil
which is assuming the gravest character. And there
can be no doubt that if the masses could be induced to
substitute the pure beverages Tea and Coffee for the
deleterious fluids they are wont to imbibe, the country
would be vastly benefited by the salutary change.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="all-caps">Now</span> that the benefits derived from the
use of Tea can be fairly estimated, it
may be said, in the language of an
eminent statesman: “What was first regarded as
a luxury, has now become, if not an absolute
necessity, at least one of our accustomed daily
wants, the loss of which would cause more suffering
and excite more regret than would the deprivation of
many things which once were counted as necessaries
of life.” Consumed by all classes, serving not simply
as an article of diet, but as a refreshing and invigorating
beverage, Tea cannot be too highly estimated.
The wisdom of successive financiers, and the enterprise<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>
of generations of merchants, have combined to
deliver Tea in this country at a price which brings it
within the reach of every individual, making it,
perhaps, the only real luxury which is common to
rich and poor alike.</p>

<p>In noticing Dr. Johnston’s work, entitled “The
Chemistry of Common Life,” the <cite>Edinburgh Review</cite>
thus emphatically attests the great boon which Tea
confers upon the people. It remarks: “By her fireside,
in her humble cottage, the lonely widow sits;
the kettle simmers over the ruddy embers, and the
blackened tea-pot on the hot brick prepares her evening
drink. Her crust of bread is scanty, yet as she
sips the warm beverage—little sweetened, it may be,
with the produce of the sugar-cane—genial thoughts
awaken in her mind; her cottage grows less dark and
lonely, and comfort seems to enliven the ill-furnished
cabin. When our suffering and wounded soldiers
were brought down frozen and bleeding from the
trenches before Sebastopol to the port of Balaklava,
the most welcome relief to their sufferings was a pint
of hot Tea, which was happily provided for them.
Whence this great solace to the weary and worn?
Why out of scanty earnings does the ill-fed and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>
lone one cheerfully pay for the seemingly unnourishing
weekly allowance of Tea? From what
ever-open fountain does the daily comfort flow
which the tea-cup gently brings to the care-worn
and the weak?”</p>

  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Picking Tea.</span>—Great care is bestowed on the finest chops of tea to sort out all

<p>Anon, referring to the chemical action of two
important agents present in Tea—theine and volatile
oil—the same excellent authority gives the following
account of their operations on the human organism:
“The theine is a substance possessing tonic or
strengthening qualities, but distinguished particularly
by the property of retarding the natural waste of the
animal body. Most people are now aware that the
chief necessity for food arises from the gradual and
constant wearing away of the tissues and solid parts
of the body. To repair and restore the worn and
wasted parts, food must be constantly eaten and
digested. And the faster the waste, the larger the
quantity of food which must daily be consumed, to
make up for the loss which this waste occasions. Now,
the introduction of a certain quantity of theine into
the stomach lessens the amount of waste which in
similar circumstances would otherwise naturally take
place. It makes the ordinary food consumed along<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span>
with it, go farther, therefore, or, more correctly,
lessens the quantity of food necessary to be eaten in
a given time. A similar effect, in a somewhat less
degree, is produced by the volatile oil, and, therefore,
the infusion of Tea, in which both these ingredients
of the leaf are contained, affects the rapidity of the
natural waste in the Tea drinker, in a very marked
manner.</p>

<p>“As age creeps on, the powers of digestion diminish
with the failing of the general vigour, till the stomach
is no longer able to digest and appropriate new food
as fast as the body wears away. When such is the
case, to lessen the waste is to aid the digestive powers
in maintaining the strength and bulk of the weakening
frame. ‘It is no longer wonderful, therefore,’ says
our author, ‘that Tea should be the favourite on the
one hand, with the poor whose supplies of substantial
food are scanty; and, on the other, with the aged
and infirm, especially of the feebler sex, whose
powers of digestion, and whose bodily substance
have together begun to fail.’ Nor is it surprising
that the aged female whose earnings are barely
sufficient to buy what are called the common
necessaries of life, should yet spare a portion of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span>
her small gains in procuring this grateful indulgence.
She can sustain her strength with less
common food when she takes her Tea along with it:
while she, at the same time, feels lighter in spirits,
more cheerful, and fitter for this dull work of life,
because of this little indulgence.”<a id="FNanchor_C" href="#Footnote_C" class="fnanchor">C</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_C" href="#FNanchor_C" class="fnanchor">C</a> <cite>Edinburgh Review</cite>, Vol. CI., No. 206, April, 1855.</p></div>

<p>Such an indispensable article as Tea has now
become, ought to be trebly guarded against all adulteration.
While the Government is unable to protect
the public against the machinations of unscrupulous
Chinese merchants, let the public at least endeavour
to protect itself. And this it can readily accomplish.
Let it but bestow its custom on a trader upon whose
integrity and technical knowledge it can implicitly
rely. Let it insist upon having both its black
and green Teas of the natural hue, without the
addition of “face,” “glaze,” or artificial colour,
which but detract from its character and value. How
such a discreet selection can be effected has already
been pointed out. Houses of repute—such, for
example, as that of Messrs. Horniman and Co.—do
not conceal their names behind a retailer, but boldly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span>
give their own, coupled with a guarantee to every
purchaser, however modest his purchase. Hence,
consumers may feel assured that in buying indirectly
from them, the commodity they obtain will not only
be free from adulteration and artificial colour, but will
be so carefully selected from the choicest growths,
commensurate with the price demanded, as to be
“always good alike.”</p>

</div>

<div><img class="drop-cap" src="images/dcd.jpg" width="79" height="80" alt="D" /></div>
<p class="drop-cap"><span class="all-caps">Dr. Lettsom,</span> in a work published over
a century since, avers that the infusion
of Tea possesses two peculiarities;
the first, a sedative quality, and the next, considerable
stringency, by which the relaxing power
is corrected so that the solids become strengthened
and braced. Indeed, this writer goes so far as
to pronounce Tea far preferable to any other
known vegetable infusion, if not drank too hot or in
too copious quantities, asserting that “if we take into
consideration its known enlivening energy, our attachment
to it will appear to be owing to its superiority
in taste and effects to most other vegetables.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span>
Dr. Edward Smith speaks of “the cup that cheers
but not inebriates” as being a potent agent, and as
increasing the quantity of carbonic acid emitted by
the lungs and the quantity of air inspired, while at
the same time it gives greater depth and freedom to
the respiration. “It is chiefly in its power,” he
remarks, “to increase the respiratory process that it
acts so favourably, and in so doing the transformation
of starchy and fatty food is promoted.” Then he
shows its vast advantages to the poor, by remarking:
“In the dietaries of the poor, where the meal must
consist chiefly of bread, a substance not particularly
savoury, nor digested with great rapidity, the warm
tea enables the recipient more readily to masticate
and swallow the dry bread, or the bread with
very little fat upon it, and so by its action to assist
digestion.”</p>

<p>The eminent Dr. Parkes avers that Tea possesses a
decidedly stimulative and restorative action on the
nervous system, while, at the same time, it obviates
succeeding depression. This writer regards Tea as
a most useful article in cases of fever, when administered
in the form of a cold, weak solution, and as
being of great service to gouty subjects, and to those<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>
of a rheumatic tendency (especially such as labour
under lithic acid diathesis) when drunk without sugar
and with little milk. Tea has been known to save
life in cases of poisoning by tartar-emetic, the tannin
being the active agent. Dr. Lewis’s testimony also
goes to support the medicinal importance of Tea.
He mentions how it strengthens the stomach and
intestines, is good against indigestion, nausea, and
diarrhœa, refreshes the spirit in heaviness and sleepiness,
and counteracts the operation of inebriating
liquors.</p>

<p>Some men of mark in their day were notorious for
their Tea-drinking predilections. Dr. Johnson himself
may be fairly set down as a Tea-gourmet. Then returning
to more modern times, see how the genial
Leigh Hunt bursts forth into rapture when describing
the virtues of the beneficent plant, free from the cunning
transformation practised upon it by unprincipled
traders. Surely this gifted writer must have had a cup
of Messrs. Horniman and Co.’s spécialité served to
him when he could elaborate upon it thus: “It was
not green tea; it was not black tea; neither too
young, nor too old; not unpleasing with astringency
on the one hand, nor with the insipid, half-earthy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span>
taste of decayed vegetable matter on the other; it
was tea in its most perfect state, full charged with
aroma, which, when it was opened, diffused its
fragrance through the whole apartment, putting all
other perfumes to shame.... Oh heavens!
to sip that most exquisite cup of delight, was bliss
almost too great for earth; a thousand years of
rapture all concentrated into the space of a minute,
as if the joy of all the world had been skimmed for
my peculiar drinking, I should rather say imbibing,
for to have swallowed that liquid like an ordinary
beverage, without tasting every drop, would have
been sacrilege.”</p>

<p>Professor James F. W. Johnston likewise bears
testimony to the value of this tropical beverage. He
remarks: “In the life of most persons a period arrives
when the stomach no longer digests enough of the
ordinary elements of food to make up for the natural
daily waste of the bodily substance. The size and
weight of the body, therefore, begin to diminish more
or less perceptibly. At this period tea comes in as a
medicine to arrest the waste, to keep the body from
falling away so fast, and thus to enable the less
energetic powers of digestion still to supply as much<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span>
as is needed to repair the wear and tear of the solid
tissues.”</p>

<p>Of course the chemical value of Tea as a beverage
depends upon the presence of volatile oil, theine,
tannin, and gluten—the four substances forming its
most important ingredients—and the proportions in
which these exist. If Tea be not genuine, or if it
undergoes the artificial process of colouring, its
character and efficacy become proportionately impaired.
It is unfortunately too true that the market
is glutted with Tea—which is either not Tea at all, or
else is excessively adulterated. On the testimony of
the House of Commons, “millions of pounds of sloe,
liquorice, and ash-tree leaves, are every year mixed
with Chinese Teas for England.” It is well known
that the leaves of the Charrapal, a Californian bush,
are largely exported to China, when they return
packed under the title of Tea. A startling exposure
was made a few years since, of the tea-rubbish styled
“Finest New Season Kaisow,” and “Fine Oanfa
Congou,” sold in bond at 1¼d. to 1¾d. per lb. Upon
analysis, the former was found to contain an enormous
amount of mineral matter, chiefly iron filings; while
the latter proved a mixture of redried tea-leaves,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span>
straw, fragments of matting, rice-husks, willow
leaves, and the excrement of silkworms. The “Maloo
Mixture,” likewise, once gained an unenviable
notoriety, as did the “Extra Fine Moyune Gunpowder”
put up for sale by auction in Mincing Lane,
and in which Dr. Letheby discovered over 40 per
cent. of iron filings and 19 per cent. of silica.</p>

<p>Tea is adulterated in two ways. The foreign
dealers first practise their arts upon it by having
recourse to dried leaves, and by “facing”—a process
which necessitates the use of Prussian blue, silica,
gypsum, plumbago, lamp-black, ferruginous earth,
and other abominations. Mr. Fortune, in his interesting
work, reveals the whole secret. Upon reading
his graphic account of how Tea is elaborated for the
European market, one almost turns aghast! And
with good reason, as there might be ample cause to
suspect “death in the pot.” Indeed, the people of
China are themselves disgusted at the tricks of traders,
who carry on their fraudulent practices without concealment.
A Chinese journal thus gives expression
to the public sentiment: “The wonder is that such
stuff (referring to redried and recoloured leaves) should
be suffered to be manufactured, much less to be shipped<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span>
as a lawful export, for Chinese law expressly prohibits
the re-manipulation of Tea that has once been used,
on the obvious and common-sense principle that such
a trade is necessarily, in its very essence, fraudulent.
Yet, in the face of this well-known maxim, it is one
of the thousand proofs which we have of the utter
rottenness of the present administration, that all round
the settlement, in every convenient open space, large
quantities of what is termed, with ominous propriety,
the ‘mixture,’ lie exposed to the sun at noon-day; in
some cases within a hundred yards of the mixed court
yamen. And not only so, but there are establishments,
well known to the police, where the mixture is fired,
leaded, packed, sold, and dispatched for shipment;
and experience has shown that it is useless to
expect conviction, under Chinese law, from a Chinese
magistrate.”</p>

<p>The same journal, referring to a peculiar kind
of willow which grows abundantly in the country,
the leaves of which are utilised by Tea manufacturers,
observes: “One needs not the expensive craft of the
cha-sze to know how neatly a little skilful manipulation,
and a little heat applied <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">secundum artem</i>, can
transform these willow leaves into genuine and delicate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span>
tea leaves. Whether the mercantile result be intended
to astonish the palates of old ladies in London or
Glasgow, or to pass as genuine Souchong with skippers,
who have little knowledge of Tea, we know not; but
the fact remains, that the trade thrives well and
pays.</p>

<p>“Nevertheless, there is still good and pure Tea produced
in China, and merchants in London who import
it in an unadulterated condition, albeit a very large
per centage of the 188,000,000 lbs. annually consumed
in Great Britain is spurious. One mercantile Firm in
particular have gained a wide and well-deserved
reputation for the purity and excellent character of
their importations. I refer with pleasure to Messrs.
Horniman and Co., London, who for nearly forty
years have assiduously laboured to supply the public
with both green and black Tea, free from all mineral
facing powder. As what passes through the Wormwood-street
Warehouses to their Agents all over the
country is subjected to no deteriorating and deleterious
manipulation in China, its perfect purity can implicitly
be relied upon. The Chinese letter which accompanied
the first shipment, by Messrs. Horniman, of Tea into
England, is quite original and unique.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span>
The translation reads <span class="locked">thus:—</span></p>

<p>“The Flourishing Farm.—This is truly the very
best Tea, prepared with additional labour and free from
colouring matter. The educated (or experienced)
merchant, who is competent to consider it, will please
to take notice of its clear and genuine quality. We
are honoured by your good orders, and shall proceed
at once to the packing.”</p>

<p>The testimony afforded by several eminent analytical
authorities in favour of Messrs. Horniman’s
importations is so satisfactory that nothing further
can well be desired. The earliest of those documents
is from Dr. Andrew Ure, F.R.S., Professor of
Chemistry, who declares that upon chemical and
microscopic examination of the samples taken
from the bonded warehouses, he “found them (both
black and green) to be perfectly free from all
extraneous colouring matter, and in every respect
genuine Tea.”</p>

<p>Professor Ure further observes:—“The characteristic
appearance of your green Tea, namely the
dull olive hue, is unmistakably different to the bright
blue tint of the ordinary green Teas of commerce,
which is artificially imparted. This particular feature<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span>
offers a perfect safeguard for the purity of the Tea, in
contrast with such sophisticated Teas as I have sometimes
been called upon to examine professionally
for the Honourable Board of Excise, and which
were coated with various powders that rendered them
more or less unwholesome for use as an alimentary
beverage.”</p>

<p>Dr. Arthur Hill Hassall, Analyst of the County
Sanitary Commission, and a well known writer and
authority on dietetics, after minutely describing the
tests to which he subjected the Tea submitted to him
for analysis, concludes in the following words:—“These
investigations enable me confidently to
assume that the consumers of Tea, now having
fairly the choice of both the sophisticated and the pure,
will not be slow in choosing between the wholesome
natural kinds and those which are ‘got up’ for appearance,
and in order to realise higher prices through
their defects being hidden or glazed over, with the
powdered colours employed.” The latest report is from
the same authority, and bears a recent date. The
opinion at first pronounced is therein but more strongly
confirmed. The Tea is characterised as being “perfectly
pure, of superior quality, and free from facing.”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span>
Moreover, the packages which the analyst purchased
from some of Messrs. Horniman’s Agents, he affirms,
after careful examination, “to correspond as regards
purity and excellence of quality with those Teas
obtained from the Docks and from Messrs. Horniman’s
Wholesale Warehouses, in London.”</p>

<p>Nor do authors and publicists of weight refrain
from offering willing testimony in favour of Messrs.
Horniman’s special importation. Dr. Scoffern remarks
how “Its delicious flavour fully confirms its
entire freedom from the usual powdered colour;”
that he is “very partial to Tea;” and that, in consequence
of having long taken the pure beverage, his
palate had become “the more critical.”</p>

<p>The only certain way to obtain truly cheap and
choice Tea is to purchase the leaf without the
usual mineral “facing” powder. That the public
highly appreciate real economy is evident from the
large and increasing trade carried on for the past
forty years by Messrs. Horniman &amp; Co., the original
importers of the pure Tea. Further, the Agents of
the Firm throughout the Kingdom, through Messrs.
Horniman’s direct operations, offer great advantages
to the public, as they sell in the most distant neighbourhoods<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span>
the same reliable article, at the same fixed
price, as their most extensive City or West-end Agents.
In another article on Tea Consumption, appears the
following: “Since the recent Parliamentary Report
on Tea appeared, there has been a more general disinclination
to use any that has been covered by the
Chinese with mineral colour, for this report exposed
the fact that it is done to hide the brownness of
wintry growths, and enable them, when so disguised,
to be sold mixed off with the best at high rates. From
a lengthened experience I can bear testimony to the
excellent and delicious character of Horniman’s
<em>pure Tea</em>; while I am convinced that all who
appreciate a strong, rich, full-flavoured beverage,
possessing in addition a delicious flavour and
aroma, must arrive at the like conclusion.”</p>

<div><img class="drop-cap" src="images/dcw.jpg" width="80" height="80" alt="W" /></div>
<p class="drop-cap in00"><span class="all-caps">What</span> should mainly commend itself to
our attention at the tea-table, is the
quality of the infusion. This is the
crucial test. If the leaf be genuine, the proof is
ready at hand. If otherwise, the proof is equally
apparent, no matter how skilfully the leaf may be
prepared to deceive the eye. The pleasure of our
morning and evening meal is much enhanced when
the infusion is fragrant, lustrous, pleasant to the
palate, and soothing to the nerves. Such covetable
results, however, cannot be realised by those who,
influenced by a false and flagrant economy, are led
to purchase so-called “cheap Teas,”—noxious
mixtures that in all probability have already done
duty in Chinese tea-pots.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span>
A lady of our acquaintance, while in the act of
pouring out the grateful beverage, recently remarked,
half-apologetically: “What a very poor colour this
Tea has! Either it must be uncoloured, or else the
Chinese have not put sufficient colouring matter
on the leaf!” To the inexperienced this remark
naturally suggests the observation—“Do the Chinese
really add ‘colouring’ for the purpose of giving a
deep colour to the Tea in the cup?” Be reassured
then, gentle reader, and understand that the terms
“coloured” and “uncoloured” are used to distinguish
betwixt that Tea which is painted or faced with mineral
powder, principally Prussian blue and plumbago, and
that which is <em>pure</em>, and free from any such prejudicial
embellishments. A deep rich semi-transparent infusion
is always obtained from good and pure Tea.</p>

<p>But for this popular error respecting the colour of
Tea, I should scarcely have trenched on the precincts
of the Tea-table—that forbidden ground, where the
housewife is universally regarded as the very model
of perfection, and where her power, for the time
being, is admittedly supreme.</p>

<p>The Chinese, whatever may be the character of the
nefarious arts to which they resort to make the best of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span>
a bad commodity, can and do send us supplies of good
Tea. But then a fair price must needs be paid for it.
Such consumers of the beverage as are willing to
procure genuine Tea, and not lay out their money
upon redried, rerolled, and “doctored” Tea-leaves,
would do well to exercise judgment by selecting only
those descriptions of Tea that have been carefully
plucked in the early spring, when the leaf is small
and imbued with the richness of the shrub-juices. Let
but such a commodity be supplied perfectly uncoloured,
and the perfection of human art is attained. When
the foolish fashion of the age required Tea pretty
to look at, then the Chinese, in deference to the public
desire, and for the increased profits of those concerned,
coloured or “faced” the leaf.</p>

<p>In conclusion, I may honestly aver that it is owing
to the efforts of Messrs. Horniman that this reprehensible
practice is fast falling into disfavour with
the public. The enormous sale of the Firm’s pure
Tea by some 4,000 Chemists, at once testifies to the
high approval it has realised for its combinedly
strong, delicious, and invigorating qualities.</p>

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site

  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
